    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      This report presents the design and development of an Agentic AI Mail Assistant,
      a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and APIs to automate email management. 
      The purpose of this report is to document the complete workflow of the project â€” from 
      conception and methodology to implementation and results â€” while highlighting the challenges 
      and solutions encountered during development.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The project focuses on simplifying the way users interact with their inboxes. Using the Gmail API, the assistant retrieves the latest important emails, processes their contents, and stores them in structured JSON files.</li>
      <li>With the help of an LLM (initially LLaMA 3 via Ollama, later optimized using the Gemini API), these emails are summarized into concise, meaningful insights.</li>
      <li>A user-friendly Streamlit interface then allows users to view summaries, expand to see the full email, generate AI-powered draft responses, and send replies directly using the Gmail API.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This integration of retrieval, summarization, and automated response generation demonstrates how agentic AI systems can reduce cognitive load, save time, and enhance productivity in everyday tasks.

      <p>Email is one of the most widely used forms of digital communication, but managing it effectively continues to be a major challenge. Overflowing inboxes, lengthy email threads, and repetitive responses often consume valuable time and attention, reducing overall productivity. As organizations and individuals increasingly rely on email for professional and personal communication, the need for intelligent systems to simplify inbox management has grown.</p>
      <p>This project addresses that challenge by developing an Agentic AI Mail Assistant â€” a system designed to automate and streamline email handling using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). The assistant performs three core tasks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Retrieval</strong> - Fetching the most recent important emails using the Gmail API.</li>
        <li><strong>Summarization</strong> - Condensing long or complex messages into concise summaries through an LLM.</li>
        <li><strong>Response Generation</strong> - Providing AI-powered draft replies that users can review, modify, and send directly via the Gmail API.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The project began with experiments using a local LLaMA 3 model via Ollama, which offered strong capabilities but limited speed. To improve responsiveness, the system was later optimized with the Gemini API, delivering faster inference and more reliable results. On the front end, a simple yet effective Streamlit-based interface was built to give users direct control over their inbox.</p>
      <p>Through this integration of retrieval, summarization, and intelligent response generation, the Mail Agent demonstrates how agentic AI systems can be applied to real-world productivity challenges, reducing manual effort while keeping the user in control.</p>
